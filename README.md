Angular CLI is a command-line tool, which works great when you want to serve an application or generate a simple component. But it falls short once you start doing advanced things.

- Exploring custom schematic collections is hard in the terminal, but it's easy using Angular Console.
- Using rarely-used flags is challenging. Do you pass absolute or relative paths? You don't have to remember any flags, names, or paths --â€ŠAngular Console will help you by providing autocompletion and validating your inputs.
- Finding the right Angular CLI extension can take a long time. When using Angular Console, you can find and install an extension in minutes.

#### Angular Console does more than that:

- It visualizes the results of a build or a test run.
- It visualizes how different projects in your workspace depend on each other.
- It shows dry run results as you create your command
- It shows remembers you most recent cli commands and saves their output for your reference
